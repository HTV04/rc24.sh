**Current release: v1.0**

rc24.sh is a patcher for RiiConnect24 services, written in Bash. Currently, it is compatible with macOS and Linux.

Please check out the [RiiConnect24 website](https://rc24.xyz/) if you want to learn more about RiiConnect24.

[TheShadowEevee](https://github.com/TheShadowEevee) ported person66's Sharpii to .NET Core, allowing Sharpii to work flawlessly on Unix-like operating systems. Check it out [here](https://github.com/TheShadowEevee/Sharpii-NetCore)!

## Setup
* Ensure your device is connected to the internet, as it is needed for rc24.sh to download files.
* Insert your Wii's SD card into your computer, if possible.

* Download the latest version of rc24.sh [here](https://github.com/HTV04/rc24.sh/releases/latest).
* Open a terminal.
  * Install the `curl` and `xdelta3` packages using your default package manager. Please consult your distro's information on installing packages if you are having trouble doing this.
  * Navigate to the folder rc24.sh has been downloaded to (using `ls` to show the files in the current folder and `cd [folder name here]` to enter a folder).
* Type `chmod +x rc24.sh` into the terminal and press return.
* Type `./rc24.sh` into the terminal and press return. rc24.sh will now start.

## Roadmap
* Support for extra RiiConnect24 services, akin to the original RiiConnect24 Patcher.
